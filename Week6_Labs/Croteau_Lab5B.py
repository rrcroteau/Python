#PROGRAM PROMPT: Re-write lab 5A but instead of searching for a personâ€™s name, search for their birthday.  If the person is found, reprint their entire record to the console.  The program should allow the user to search for as many birthdays as they want. The program should also print a statement telling the user how many iterations of the search loop the program went through before finding (or not finding) the requested person.

#Extra Credit +10 points: print the user the found person, their data, along with their current age. 

#--VARIABLE DICTIONARY--#

#records --> INT, holds the number of records (people) processed
#csvfile --> shorthand name for file location, full file path
#file --> friendly name for file data, after it has been passed through csv.reader()
#rec --> LIST, an individual record from the file; only used when connected to file
#lname - LIST, STR, contains the last names
#fname - LIST, STR, contains the first names
#dob - LIST, STR, contains the date of birth
#answer - STR, used to control the search loop
#search - STR, contains the search parameter as input by the user
#found - INT, used for determining if a record has been found and then the index where found is set as the value
#search_count - INT, contains the number of searches conducted by the sequential search
#curr_month - INT, contains the current month
#curr_day - INT, contains the current day
#curr_year - INT, contains the current year
#split_dob - LIST, contains the dob split into day, month, and year
#birth_month - INT, contains the birth month
#birth_day - INT, contains the birth day of month 
#birth_year - INT, contains the year of birth  
#age - INT, the current age of the person searched
