#WEEK 6 DAY 1: Sequential Search

#Sequential Search: Sequential search means to search through an entire list (array), starting at the first record and looking through every one until the last, when looking for something. 

 

#For Loops --> allow us to process every record in an list (for index in range(0, records) --> this applies to every record in the list)

#If Statements --> allow us to "search": compare a value in the list we are looking through against the value(s) we are looking for. 

#we are utilizing binary.txt for this demo
#       FIELD0     #FIELD1     FIELD2      FIELD3
#       ID nums    Names       Age         Color

#END OF SEQUENTIAL SEARCH ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#START OF BINARY SEARCH --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#BINARY SEARCH is a much faster searching method but can only be performed on ORDERED LISTS

#Binary Search splits a list into a "low" end and a "high" end and compares the value in the middle of the list against what the user is searching for.  If that middle point has a greater value than the value the user is seeking, the low half of the list is "dropped" (dropped ie no longer searching through those records).  When the middle point has a lesser value, the high half of the list is dropped.  

#in order for a list to be ordered it needs to either be in increasing or decreasing alpha or numeric order

#INCREASING: A -> Z / 0 -> 1000
        #   Lowest value of list is in index [0]
        #   Highest value of list is in index [records - 1]

#DECREASING: Z -> A / 1000 -> 0
        #   Highest value of list is in index [0]
        #   Lowest value of list is in index [records - 1]

binary_loop = 0 #counts the number of times through the binary search loop

#setting up starting values of min/max/guess -- INDEX VALUES -- represent points within the SEARCHED THROUGH LIST

min = 0 #reps the lowest possible starting index for the list we're seraching through

max = records - 1 #reps the highest possible ending index

guess = int((min + max) / 2) #middle position/index between min and max
                             #truncating the numeric value -- dropping all decimal value
                             #make sure to cast as an INTEGER for truncation!

#MIN, MAX, GUESS are all locations of value (ie index)
#searching loop --> name[] is in INCREASING ORDER, ALPHA
while (min < max and search != name[guess]):
    
    binary_loop += 1 #adding +1 for sequential search comparison
    
    #we are re-using the search term from sequential search (search)
    #condition reads: while the value of min (index #) is less than value of max (index #)
    #                   ---> still items to check in list
    #                 and the serach term value is not equal to the value found in the middle of min and max

    #this loop continues as long as min remains less than max [min < max]
    #these are index numbers, so if min becomes greater than max we've exhausted the list ie searched through and the items is not found

    #this loop also continues so long as what we are looking for has nt yet been found [search != name[guess]
    #this is bc the loop is actively serachng so it should kick is out at one of two points
    #               * exhausted list, searched item not found
    #               * searched item is found

    if search < name[guess]: #value we're looking for is less than the middle point, drop the high end of the list

        max = guess - 1
        #drops higher value half of list
        #new end of searched through list becomes middle point


    else: #search > name[guess]

        min = guess + 1
        #drops lower value half of list
        #new start of searched through list becomes middle point

    #since max or min have changed, we need a new middle point to check our value against
    guess = int((min + max) / 2)
    
#CHECK TO SEE WHY YOUVE EXITED THE SEARCH LOOP
if search == name[guess]:

    print(search, " name was FOUND at index: ", guess)
    #print entire record of searched item's info
